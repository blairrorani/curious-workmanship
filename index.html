  <h2>Understanding the scriptures can be hard &#x1f914;</h2>
  <p>Reading the scriptures isn't like reading a novel or an instruction manual. You need to figure out who is doing what, where and when they are, and why they are doing it. Only then is it easy to identify doctrines and principles that you can apply to your own life.<p>
  <p>If pictures can paint 1,000 words, then pictures can also make the scriptures easier to understand.<p>
