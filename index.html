<h2>Coming soon: Scripture cards</h2>
<img src="{{ "/images/scripture-cards.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="{{ site.title }}" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">

<p>As you probably know, studying the scriptures &#x1f4dc; isn't the same thing as reading a novel or an instruction manual &#x1f4da;. Before you can learn from the scriptures you need to understand their background and context. Then you're better able to identify doctrines and principles which you can hopefully apply in your daily life.</p>
<p>To help you get started with the 'understanding' part, I'm designing some scripture cards &#x1f0cf;. These are a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_card">trading cards</a> but not exactly. They're more for visualising and playing with. Scripture cards will be a tool to help you visualise the people, places, and things you're reading about.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You could summarise the background of a block of scripture using the cards for the people &#x1f600;, places &#x1f3d4;, and things &#x1f56f; involved in the scripture block. This could be before you read to get context or after you read to review.</li>
    <li>You could use some of the people cards to show the relationships between family members, record keepers, or kings &#x1f451;.</li>
    <li>You could create sets of 'goodies' &#x1f642; and 'baddies' &#x1f47f;.</li>
    <li>You could visualise journeys or battles (maps &#x1f5fa; are a separate product in the works).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sound interesting? &#x1f914;</h3>
