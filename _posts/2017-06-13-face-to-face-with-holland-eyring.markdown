After speaking at a fireside about revelation this past week, I have been thinking more about the subject. Although I've experienced some moments of revelation throughout my life, it's definitely not something that I'm great at.

This morning I watched part of the [Face-to-face broadcast featuring Elder Holland and President Eyring](https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/eyring-holland?lang=eng). I focussed on the part about how to tell if you're receiving revelation from the Holy Ghost, or if it's just your own thoughts and feelings.

I learned that we can look for a feeling of peace if what we're receiving is from God. We can also expect revelation to be consistent with the teachings of the Saviour and His prophets. Elder Holland emphasised that often we need to repeat the process of asking and then trusting and acting. This is how we learn "line upon line". President Eyring also explained that we should feel love for the Saviour and His servants.

While I've definitely got a long way to go in this area, I feel like I have a greater understanding of the 'recipe for revelation' thanks to this talk.
