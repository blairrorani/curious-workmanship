I attended a Bishop's youth discussion last night. The discussion was based on a couple of the Q and A sessions from Elder Holland and President Eyring's face-to-face broadcast. Here are some of the visual notes I took.

The first question we watched was How can I feel the [Holy Ghost more often?](https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/eyring-holland?lang=eng#00:27:14) What stood out to me was being quiet inside as in asking, but then trying to silence our own thoughts so that we can listen to and feel the Holy Ghost speaking to us. One of the councillors in the bishopric explained that often we'll receive clarifying thoughts as well as peaceful feelings. They compliment each other and can give us confidence about what we believe we're receiving. I liked how President Eyring explained that he visualises himself approaching God on His throne and being willing to receive whatever answer He gives him.

Next we watched [How can I get comfort from my patriarchal blessing?](https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/eyring-holland?lang=eng#00:46:48) What was interesting about this answer was that President Eyring said we shouldn't always expect comfort. Sometimes a patriarchal blessing can be a warning. He also taught that we should live our lives in faith and wait for our blessing to be fulfilled throughout our lives rather than discount parts that we believe we've 'missed out on'.

The last question was [What can I do to stay positive and know that I am enough?](https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/eyring-holland?lang=eng#01:12:45) I loved this question because it's something that I have always asked in some form. As always, the answers were really positive. Elder Holland reminded us that we should expect to receive help from our ancestors who are beyond the veil. I remember learning of that principle when I was at Church College but have often forgotten it ðŸ˜³ One thing I'm going to do differently from listening to the answers to this question is to reflect on my 'successes' while I'm preparing to take the sacrament, rather than just my shortcomings (which aren't hard to think of).
