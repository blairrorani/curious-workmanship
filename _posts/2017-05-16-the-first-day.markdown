Today I officially started working on Curious Workmanship - a project that I've had on the back burner for a few years now. Finally knew this was the time to start it.

My goal is to design and share lots of practical, visual resources for people who want to learn and apply the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

The original idea for this project was watching my children, youth, adults, (anyone really) studying the scriptures. First of all, the language can be hard. Plus they aren't necessarily written like a novel or a text book. I realised that a big part of learning lessons from the scriptures and hopefully being able to apply those lessons is understanding what is going on in the verses you're reading. Information like who are the people mentioned, where and when are they, who is saying what to who, and who is doing what.

I felt inspired to use my design skills and interest in the scriptures to make it easy to understand the background and context to a given block of scripture so that people can get on with the business of learning from what is being said and done.

So that's the initial focus of Curious Workmanship - making illustrations of the people, places and things to explain what is happening in the scriptures. I'll post some of my work in progress leading up to the launch of my first set of resources.
