Visual notes from a [talk given by Linda K. Burton](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/well-ascend-together?lang=eng).

> "Later in the funeral, the oldest son tearfully expressed that all he had ever hoped in this life was to be like his beloved father."

I loved this quote. Although I'm far away from being that kind of farther, it definitely gives me something inspiring to aim for.

> "Sisters and brothers, how often do we intentionally 'speak kind words to each other'?"

Easier 'said' than done, I like the idea of finding opportunities to speak kind words.

> "The nature of male and female spirits is such that they complete each other."

Sister Burton gave me a timely reminded that husbands and wives can fit together by complimenting each other, rather than competing with each other.

As [my wife](http://facebook.com/leilanirorani) and I celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary 🤵💖👸 (every five years feels like such a great milestone to reach) I pray that I can learn and apply the lessons taught in this talk.

🎥 Plus, here's [a time lapse video](/uploads/ascend-together.m4v) of me drawing the notes.
