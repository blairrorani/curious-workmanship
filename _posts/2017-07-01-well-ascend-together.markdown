Visual notes from a [talk given by Linda K. Burton](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/well-ascend-together?lang=eng).

> "Later in the funeral, the oldest son tearfully expressed that all he had ever hoped in this life was to be like his beloved father."

I loved this quote. Although I'm far away from being that kind of farther, it definitely gives me something inspiring to aim for.

> "Sisters and brothers, how often do we intentionally “speak kind words to each other”?



⭐️ Plus, here's [a time lapse video](/uploads/ascend-together.m4v) of me drawing the notes.
