> 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
>
> 15 Neither do men light a acandle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
>
> 16 Let your alight so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
