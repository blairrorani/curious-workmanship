Hello I'm [Blair Rorani](http://blair.rorani.com).

I love the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I try to learn and live it the best that I can, and I teach my children to do the same.

I use my background as a designer to make practical, visual resources for learning and living the Gospel (things like trading cards, maps, scripture mastery flashcards, and infographics).

Curious Workmanship is a way for me to share these resources with people like you.
